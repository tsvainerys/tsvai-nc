        <p>Hi, I'm T'Svai. I started this website to share things I like. Funnily enough, I currently like coding the site more than
            writing any actual content for it. After I get it set up, I'd like to write about my OCs and favorite Star Trek characters.
            Other than that, I hope to learn more about HTML, CSS and JavaScript through maintaining this site.
