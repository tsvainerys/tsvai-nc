          <p>I've been working on figuring out how to add my paracosm stuff to the website, as well as add a blog
            so that I actually update more often. Today, you get the fruits of the (relatively) simpler task. I don't know how often
            I'll actually update this blog, but I'm very satisfied with the work I've done on getting it set up over the past few days.
