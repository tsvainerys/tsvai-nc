          <p>Today I decided to update the website after making an HTML itinerary for a trip I have coming up.
            I mainly did that to practice and have and easy-to-update graphic to share in my group chat later,
            and it inspired me to just touch up the little things I wasn't satisfied with the last time I updated.
          </p>
          <p>I've added a lot of things which took me many hours to get everything working in a way that I, a mid-tier
            hobbyist, am satisfied with. I ended up adding a list of albums that I like, as well as putting my
            rinky-dink javascript game under miscellaneous projects. Overall, I'm pretty happy with how everything
            turned out, and I hope to add more things eventually.</p>
