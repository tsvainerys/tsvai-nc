          <p>It's been a pretty eventful start to the year. I've gotten more work, and failed a few times at it. Hopefully, those mistakes won't be so common by the end of the year. On matters more relevant to this blog, I've spent some time updating my Gaia Online profile CSS to have tabs. It's always fun pushing the profile editor to see what I, with my limited abilities, can get away with. I mostly learned a lot about positioning and how using relative units like vw and vh can really help to make an absolutely-positioned layout work on more than one screen.</p>
<p>On matters of hobbies and interests, I've gotten properly back into knitting after straining my wrist pretty badly a year ago by... knitting way too much. I usually say I "knit too close to the sun," since, in my hubris, I attempted to finish a beret during the snow days before my last semester of uni began so that I could log it for that season's challenge in the Star Trek-themed Ravelry group I was (and technically still am) in. I'm currently trying to knit a pair of <a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/chilly-podsters" target="_blank">Chilly Podsters</a>, and have had to mess around with it because I: A. am using an aran weight yarn instead of a worsted, B. refused to knit a swatch, and C. had to restart because the stitch gauge was off by one single stitch. Before getting back into knitting, I'd started tatting a <a href="https://lilliantatlace.wordpress.com/2022/04/14/flower-cube-free-3d-tatting-pattern/" target="_blank">Flower Cube</a> to get more practice after having tatted some Christmas presents for my friends. It's been fun to join the square motifs together into a cube shape, and before I'd decided to start my gloves, I was working on the fourth face of the cube.</p>
<p>In addition to getting back into knitting, I've gained new media interests, which is nothing new, really. I watched Pantheon on Netflix and then lamented there only being one season, until I went to the Tumblr tag &ndash; as is routine for me when I finish any piece of media &ndash; and found that there <em>was</em> another season, just that it wasn't streaming in the US, for some reason. I then found the second season and watched it, and loved it deeply. Go watch it! I rarely care about spoiling others, but this is my only exception, it's a must-watch kind of show.</p>
<p>Besides Pantheon, I got into League of Legends lore, largely to my own bewilderment. I'd listened to the music Riot puts out on occasion, like K/DA and the NewJeans one (yes, I was an avid K-pop fan, once), but I hadn't listened to Paranoia, for some reason. To my surprise (since I wasn't paying attention, I guess), Byun Baekhyun was singing the bridge and chorus, and I (once a mild EXO fan) was hooked. I watched the MV and checked out the Tumblr tag for Heartsteel and got kind of obsessed with Ezreal. I read his lore and everything. I stewed in this hyperfixation for a few days before coming across one of my Tumblr mutuals reblogging an Arcane gifset, and decided to watch the show, since it fit into the brainrot of the moment. I watched it, and got hooked. I finished it yesterday and today was the day where I started sorting through all the LoL posts I'd liked, a medley of Arcane gifsets, Heartsteel memes, and various pieces of Ezko fanart.</p>
<p>All in all, the beginning of the year has been very eventful and I hope it goes well, despite all the horrors of the real world.</p>
