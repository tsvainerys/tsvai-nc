          <p>Like with most things, I started teaching myself to make static Firefox themes last night. For my first theme, I made one using an <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TZrAMwTW2yqJpomGznbDTw5CFzWgTLwk?usp=drive_link">upscaled screengrab</a> from Arcane of the Firelights' base with some basic color changes to make it flow. That one I finished within the hour, so I started another that would change based on whether or not my laptop was in light or dark mode. I went with two images of the Bridge of Progress (from the same folder, immense thanks to Mewthree): One of the bridge during the day, and one at night. That theme I finished earlier today, and have been riding the high of it since. Messing around with JSON files made me want to code a little more, so I decided to update the site today!</p>
<h3>Paracosm</h3>
<p>The first thing I wanted to get out of the way was actually adding to my Paracosm section (which I added a while back, but never actually pushed to the website). I've been adding a lot to it since getting into Runeterra lore, mostly worldbuilding things I feel comfortable sharing because they're wholly original. The Paracosm section at the moment is quite sparse, but I hope to add more to it throughout the year. Currently, the only pages are about characters and even then only basic information about them, but I hope to add pages linking them all at some point. <a href="../../paracosm/home.html">Link here to the Paracosm homepage</a>.</p>
<h3>Game</h3>
<p>Along with updating the Paracosm section, I also updated <a href="../../misc/game.html">the little JavaScript game</a> I have in my miscellaneous section, mainly because I had some more of the options drafted in Twine and because it centers around <a href="../../paracosm/people/madame-svar.html">Madame Svar</a>, one of the characters in my Paracosm. As a result, she's the character that you might most be able to learn about. I hope anyone who reads this has fun!</p>
