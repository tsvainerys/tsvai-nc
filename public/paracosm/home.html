        <h3>Welcome to</h3>
        <h1>The Paracosm</h1>
        <h2>introduction</h2>
        <p>A paracosm is a fictional world created in childhood, sometimes maintained into adulthood.
           Mine has been developed over the course of around 18 years, and continues to expand daily.
           I am now sharing it with you.
        </p>
        <p>My paracosm developed around fiction I've enjoyed, with the idea of the characters existing
            alongside their media being central to most of the concepts in it. Most of the information shared about my paracosm here will be worldbuilding stuff and sharing
           of the actually original characters.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, the pages here are based around a list of things I've thought about lately. The list
            can be read below.
        </p>
